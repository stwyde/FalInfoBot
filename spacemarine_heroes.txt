**Tell me about SPACE MARINE HEROES?**
A Japan-exclusive range of minis! Each model is in easy-to-build style, cast in blue plastic, with a detailed, moulded base and options for either helmet or helmetless heads. Built to "real-scale", they are larger than the classic Dark Vengeance marines, but smaller than modern Primaris. A set of twelve, packaged in "mystery boxes", includes enough guys for a complete tactical squad with options for the heavy and special weapons! There is even an independently-boxed captain to lead your army into battle!

**How much are SPACE MARINE HEROES?**
Each individual box is 750 yen (£5/$6.50) including taxes, a full set is 9,000 Yen (£60/$81), a full box of 24 is 18,000 yen (£120/$162). There is also a special Captain that you can buy separately with the set. He is 3,000 yen (£20/$27) per box.
