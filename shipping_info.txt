**How much is shipping?**
Everyone asks this. I don't know until I have boxes in hand because the totals, once packed, may differ from my initial quote. Just tell me what you want and what will be will be re: shipping.
Following a frowny amount of missing shipments in the most recent group buy, as of GB8, ALL shipments will be sent via a tracked service. Up until now I have been offering untracked services, but I have just been notified of the third lost parcel in the most recent buy.
In the future I will also be requiring insurance to be paid for to the value of the parcel and for parcel values to be accurately declared. If you wish to have a lower price applied in the hope of tricking customs, that will be entirely on you and if it is lost,
you will NOT receive a full refund.
