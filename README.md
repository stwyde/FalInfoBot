# FalInfoBot
Quick and dirty Ruby based Discord bot that provides information to people asking about Fal's group buy program on the r/Warhammer40k Discord channel


This bot serves a VERY simple purpose. To give people who want information about the Group Buy the information they specifically want. That's a really poorly formatted sentence. Oof. Anyways, there are four simple commands. 

Software dependencies:
discordrb
ruby 2.5 or higher
Any dependencies that discordrb uses.
